it's incredibly unusual for me to post this many times in a week, much less twice in a day, but...

when i added that emblem at the top, i got thinking about how i had never written a game of life program. this is one of those standard things all computer science students do at one point or another, but since i didn't want to do things the standard way and had to drop my CS major, I never did.
