<p>So, it&#8217;s been a pretty long time since i&#8217;ve updated anything on this page. This is, however, no indication of work being done on InnerSpace; as a matter of fact, things are better than ever!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been restructuring some of the less stable components of the framework, namely, the network layer. I&#8217;ve opted to use the <A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com">Twisted framework</A> to provide a networking layer. This allows me to focus on the stuff that&#8217;s important for a framework like this, while having the assurance of a rock-solid networking foundation.</p>

<p>As of yet, I haven&#8217;t updated the CVS repository with the new stuff &#8212; this is definitely on the way. I&#8217;m under some time restraints, as I finally have a job, and that&#8217;s taking up a lot of my time. However, here are some things you can look forward to.</p>

<ul>
    <li> A new and nicer client, which provides some facilities for nicer text, embedded images, and a generally nicer (and more functional) experience.</li>
    <li> A fully operational verb/object and property editor.</li>
    <li> A much more efficient networking layer (thanks to <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a>).</li>
    <li> and much more&#8230;</li>
</ul>
