I'm going to be using InnerSpace as my project for Doug Lea's <A HREF="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/csc436/">Network Systems</A> class at <A HREF="http://www.oswego.edu">SUNY Oswego</A>. This is good for a couple of reasons. First of all, it'll motivate me to find more time to finish this thing that's been on my back for so very long. Second, I'll be working with <A HREF="mailto:groberts_NO_@_SPAM_oswego.edu">Greg Roberts</A>, who will provide a valuable perspective, since he's fairly unfamiliar with Python and especially InnerSpace. He'll be helping me write verbs for the game, which will serve to teach him Python, show me were things are difficult or confusing, and also locate the numerous bugs that are probably just waiting to pop out. Finally, I'll have access to DL's brain. <i>("eeexcellent...")</i>
