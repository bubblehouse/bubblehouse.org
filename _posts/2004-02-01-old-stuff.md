<p>i thought it might be nice to put up some really rough original drafts of some tunes that i've done. most of these particular ones i haven't even recorded legitimately yet.</p>

<p>some of them are particularly hilarious because they feature larry's unique vocal stylings. sometimes i really think he's more suited to being a rock star than i am...now if i could just get him to play an instrument... ;-)</p>
