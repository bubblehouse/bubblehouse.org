<p>i thought it might be nice to put up some really rough original drafts of some tunes that i&#8217;ve done. most of these particular ones i haven&#8217;t even recorded legitimately yet.</p>

<p>some of them are particularly hilarious because they feature larry&#8217;s unique vocal stylings. sometimes i really think he&#8217;s more suited to being a rock star than i am&#8230;now if i could just get him to play an instrument&#8230; ;-)</p>
