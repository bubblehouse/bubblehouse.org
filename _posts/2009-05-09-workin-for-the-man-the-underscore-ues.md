seaflux's assault on Manhattan continues on the Upper East Side. It's much like the Battle of Harlem Heights, except now the American troops will begin to party at the sound of the funk, and even with Washington's arrival on the scene they will refuse to obey orders and continue to bust a move.

If you've missed us before, you really should come to this show. If we don't get enough people to come, they're going to send Jimmy the Fingers after us.

Joining us for this conquest of your aural cavities will be bassist and Brigadier General David Parillo, recently returned from his speaking tour of small-town America, promoting his new book entitled, "Sub-Harmonic Chemistry, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Funk."
