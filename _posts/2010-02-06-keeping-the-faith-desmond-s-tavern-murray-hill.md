It's that time again. Give to seaflux your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. We'll even take the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to Desmond's Tavern, where they will find seaflux, ready to lift their lamp beside the golden door!

Come out Saturday the 6th at 8pm and prepare to have your general facial regions melted.

Also, we've agreed to waive our share of the cover so that our fans only have to pay $5, so make sure to tell the door person you're here to see seaflux!
