<p>so, although i did take some pleasure in my chosen title for this weblog, being the simpsons fanatic that i am, i decided that it sounds too much like some angsty goth kid's page of lamentations.</p>

<p>bubblehouse is relatively meaningless, except being the name of a <a href="http://www.mmw.net">mmw</a> tune that i like a lot. i also figure it's good to have the title be connected with the domain name.</p>

<p>so i leave you with the following...<BR /><BR />

<pre>
<b>Homer:</b> What's wrong with you?  What are you trying to hide from me...
       [<i>Homer opens the door and sniffs</i>]  What's that smell?  Onions...
       chili powder... cumin... juicy ground chuck?  It's chili!  Oh, my
       god, I'm missing the chili cook-off!  [<i>whining, fidgeting</i>] I'm
       missing the cook-off, it's going on right now, and I'm missing 
       it.

<b>Marge:</b> All right, I <b>was</b> trying to keep it from you, but I had a good
       reason.  Every time you go to that cook-off you get drunk as a
       poet on payday.

<em>Marge asks him to remember last year.  In a flashback, we see an
obviously drunk Homer, a Duff in each hand, standing in the cotton-
candy machine.  "Look at me...I'm a puffy pink cloud." he mumbles,
before he climbs out of the machine and lies on the ground, where dogs
lick at him.
</em>
<em>Back to the present.  Homer is shuffling around in the closet.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Well of course, everything looks bad if you remember it.  Now
       where are my chili boots?
