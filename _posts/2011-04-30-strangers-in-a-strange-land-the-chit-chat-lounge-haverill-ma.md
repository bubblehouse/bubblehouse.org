<p>not satisfied with only launching the new seaflux album "false evolution" in just one state, the power trio heads to rock epicenter the Chit Chat Lounge in Haverill, MA, for a union of epic proportions.</p>

<p>once there, the combined might of seaflux and the Southbound Outlaws will leave microscopic vibrations echoing through the foundations of northeast Massachusetts for decades to come.</p>
