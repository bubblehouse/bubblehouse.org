<p>So I&#8217;ve finally gotten a ProTools setup, after nearly two years of saying i was going to do it. My primary reason for doing so is that I&#8217;m applying to <a href="http://www.purchase.edu">Purchase</a> for the third time, and I needed to be able to put in some serious time behind the mike (or in my case, <a href="http://www.amplitube.com">amp-modelling software pre-amp</a>).</p>

<p>I had all these grand plans of getting this serious system, originally a <A href="http://www.digidesign.com/products/digi002/">Digi 002</A>, or a <a href="http://www.motu.com/english/motuaudio/896/">motu 896HD</a>, but although <a href="http://www.rescuecom.com">my new job</a> affords me some excess of cash (at least, compared to the days of unemployment benefits), i still wasn&#8217;t going to be able to get something like that in time for the auditions. I settled on the <A href="http://www.digidesign.com/products/mbox/">mbox</A>, which only has two inputs, but they&#8217;re pretty high-quality, and since i overdub everything anyways, it&#8217;s working out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been using some royalty-free samples I got my hands around, and it&#8217;s made my life much easier in the drum-sound department. This has, however, lent a distinct electronic/industrial flavor to some of my tunes.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the latest crop of compositions:</p>
