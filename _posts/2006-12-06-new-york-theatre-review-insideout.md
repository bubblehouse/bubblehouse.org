<p>We got a pretty favorable review on <a href="http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/archweb/arch2006_10.htm#236">NewYorkTheatre.com</a>. They were kind of harsh with regards to the script, but gave a favorable review overall. And of course, my favorite part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...The result is a paranoid and claustrophobic mood that manages to be hypnotically appealing at the same time. In this regard, InsideOut is indebted to its design elements, <b>particularly sound and music designer Phil Christensen's eerily seductive techno score.</b></p>

<p>I couldn't help but giggle a little bit.</p>
