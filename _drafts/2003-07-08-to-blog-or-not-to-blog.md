...that isn't really a question, since it's obvious what was my decision. i'm not sure if blogging is really for me, but i figure i'll give it a try...

i tried <A HREF="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</A> for awhile, but i just didn't like it. maybe it's because i couldn't think of anything to put it in. i figure running my own will let my customize it and maybe do some cool things. i'm not even sure what to focus on; probably music will be my focus, since that's about all i care about. maybe occasional posts about other things i'm thinking. we'll see...

one thing i don't want is some stupid blog where i talk about shit that no one would ever want to read, which may be unavoidable.

i really hate the word 'blog.'
