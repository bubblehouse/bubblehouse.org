<p>In the beginning of April, I got some friends and cohorts together to record a live ep, consisting of some of my "classics". following a delusional miles davis complex, i decided not to give the players anything to listen to of the tracks we were about to record, so they only had one rehearsal before the big day.</p>
<p>i specifically wanted something filled with "the human element", and i got exactly that. this was kind of my response to the sterilized studio environment at suny purchase, and i was very happy with the results...</p>
