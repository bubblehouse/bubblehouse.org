man, what a show...

i couldn't believe my good luck to see this show. i barely made it; i had a really good job interview in manhattan on thursday, and was so sure i was going to need to make a day trip down there that i almost didn't go to PA. of course, i didn't get the job, but before i knew that i decided it was important for me to go to this show.

when this setlist first started coming up on <A HREF="http://www.therhombus.com/forums">the rhombus</A>, a number of people surmised it was a fake. never before had phish busted out with so many rare tunes.
