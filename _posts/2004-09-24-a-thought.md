i understand why &#8220;art music&#8221; exists. i understand absurdity, dadism, the need for a composer to express himself. i understand the contributions that esoteric music has made to the mainstream, and i have composed my share of avant garde pieces to explore this facet of musical creation.

	but when i listen to your five minute atonal composition consisting of a
	grand total of seven different sounds, don't tell me that the reason i don't like
	it is because

# i don&#8217;t get you

if it&#8217;s not hard, then it&#8217;s not art. if you didn&#8217;t slave over it, then it&#8217;s just a byproduct of your quest for musical expression

##MUSICAL EXCREMENT

	but fortunately for you,

*THAT doesn't mean SHIT*
