I got a message from someone who was interested in pooking around InnerSpace today, and spent enough time providing some starter instructions that I figured I&#8217;d post them here.

	thanks a lot for writing. i&#8217;m glad some people are checking this out&#8230;

	right now the codebase isn&#8217;t really meant for public consumption. i do this primarily as a personal exercise, and although there are many parts of it that are very functional, other parts aren&#8217;t so refined&#8230;

	i&#8217;ve attached a tarball, which contains some sparse documentation. i don&#8217;t know what your level of familiarity is with Python and the Twisted library (http://www.twistedmatrix.com), but some basic concepts from those areas can get you up and running.

	First you&#8217;ll want to install Twisted if you don&#8217;t have it already, and run the setup.py script to install it in your python path.

	then you&#8217;ll need to do the same with InnerSpace (python setup.py install) which should also build a JAR file of the client for you.

	first build the server &#8220;TAP&#8221; file by running mktap innerspace
	mktap supports some options, like specifying the port number, and SSL options, but for now it&#8217;s probably best to leave them as is.

	then run the TAP file with twistd -nf innerspace.tap, which will run it in the foreground (removing the -n option daemonizes the server).

	then, run the client with:
	java -cp build/is-client.jar inner.space.client.Client

	i believe the default u/p is phil/phil or wizard/wizard

	besides &#8220;look&#8221;, there aren&#8217;t too many &#8220;real-world&#8221; verbs, as i&#8217;m working on the programming interface right now. @verb &lt;verb&gt; on &lt;obj&gt; will let you edit verb code, although i think most of the installed ones are predefined. However, this is functional enough to create new verbs, although the API for verbs is under heavy construction&#8230;you can also see the beginnings of the object editor with @edit &lt;obj&gt;

	anyways, that&#8217;s about as much as i can tell you, for now. i&#8217;m not really providing any support for this project yet; it&#8217;s open-source for philosophical reasons, but i&#8217;m going to be the sole developer until i reach a certain point, and there&#8217;s no sense in me writing any serious documentation for it until the API is complete&#8230;

	anyways, lots of luck! feel free to email me with any questions you might have, i&#8217;ll try to help you out whenever possible&#8230;

	-phil
