<p>seaflux and friends return to the Production Lounge in Greenpoint for another show of mind-blowing satisfaction. First the epic metal of Switchblade starts things off at 8pm, then Guitarbomb makes working music for the drinking class at 9pm. Finally seaflux brings it all home at 10pm, but the party keeps going after that...</p>
<p>We're rounding up all our drinking buddies for this show, so we've even got a special at the door. $5 blows your mind all night, but starts it off with a free well shot!</p>
<p>Come on out. We've got the party to soothe your jangled nerves after a long week.</p>
