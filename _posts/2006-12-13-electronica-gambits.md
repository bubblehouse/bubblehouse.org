![Electronic Gambits](http://files.bubblehouse.org.s3.amazonaws.com/electronica%20gambits.jpg)

it's funny how some things turn out.

a few years ago, i tried making an "electronic" composition, with the intent of making fun of the various genres therin. in the end, i liked working in these styles enough that i made several pieces in this vein, including, of course, the score to [InsideOut]({% post_url 2006-12-08-inside-out %}).

the chronology of these tracks is all over the place. this bothers my OCD to no end, but it does give a glimpse of the development of my compositional approach to this stuff. i'd also like to mention the following amazing pieces of software: <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se"> propellerheads' reason</a>, <a href="http://www.ableton.com">ableton live</a>, and everything ever made by the <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com">native instruments</a> company.
