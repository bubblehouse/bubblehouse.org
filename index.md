  <div class="span10">
    <p>Modern, highly virtualized IT environments require a new approach to buildout. Creation of new instances in
    response to failure or scaling needs should be as automated as possible.</p>

    <p>Our Puppet-based configuration managment tools allow us to automate anything from application deployments to
    multi-enviroment infrastructures.</p>

    <p>The same tools that provision servers can also configure the monitoring of those servers. Ensure that your 
      systems team can know what's going on at all times, and can respond proactively to potential issues.</p>

    <p>We'll help you select a suite of tools like Nagios, Cacti, AWS CloudWatch and others to ensure your
      infrastructure is up and running at all times.</p>

    <p>Source control and automated unit tests are just the beginning. A solid DevOps foundation lets your 
      development team focus on what they do best. No matter your development process, from weekly releases to
      rolling release, we can develop a customized, automated build system that takes the guesswork out of
      deploys and reduces risk during new feature development.</p>

    <p>We can help your team create build and deploy chains on Jenkins/Hudson, Travis or any other continuous
      integration toolit. Automatically build customized development VMs on-demand, so new coders can start
      contributing their first day.</p>
