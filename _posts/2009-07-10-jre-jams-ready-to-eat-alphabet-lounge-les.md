A last-minute engagement in Alphabet City allows seaflux to feed the musical masses. A collection of prepackaged survival jams are ready to provide you sustenance at the Alphabet Lounge in Loisaida.

A non-exclusive contract with the U.S. Government allows seaflux to provide these JREs (Jams Ready to Eat) to the people who need them. Various flavors of rock, funk, jazz, house and breakbeat bouillon are available to all guests.
