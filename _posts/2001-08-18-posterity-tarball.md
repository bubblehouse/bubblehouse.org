With this, the role of InnerSpace as my project for CSC436 has ended. Although I really didn't get as far as I would have liked, IS is in a reasonably functional state. There is currently no documentation or even code comments, but that will be for another version. I'm still going to grant this release the title of <A HREF="http://bubblehouse.org/innerspace/innerspace-0.5.tar.gz">innerspace-0.5</A>...
