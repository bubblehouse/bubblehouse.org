Hrm, well, where to begin? InnerSpace has been in the design process for four years now, and has been written and rewritten many, many times. Each time I always thought, "Oh, I've got everything figured out, so I should be finished Real Soon Now." Ha!

# So What Is It?

The buzzword-compliant description would be: InnerSpace is a text-based virtual reality framework that allows multiple Internet users to connect to, manipulate and aid in the creation of a limitless universe.

In other words, it's a MUD, but it's the best damn MUD out there!
