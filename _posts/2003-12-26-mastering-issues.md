it's funny...i read an article last night about how people new to mastering tend to over-do the bass end when mastering, typically putting too much boost on the super-low frequencies, and not the low frequencies that our ears hear the most of.

well, anyone who's downloaded a copy of Atmospheres, be careful listening to it at higher volumes, especially if you have any bass bost on already. i nearly blew out the speakers in my car when i first tried to listen to it. ;-)

anyways, i hope to have a newly mastered version of it up in a day or two...

UPDATE: man, i never did that, did i? oh well...
