<p>i&#8217;ve been trying to work on more tunes with vocal tracks, as vocals seem to be pretty much the hardest kind of &#8220;instrument&#8221; to record. then there&#8217;s also the additional fact that while i don&#8217;t <i>hate</i> the sound of my own voice, i definitely feel uncomfortable listening to it. this is something i need to get over, and i guess there&#8217;s only one way to do it.</p>

<p>I got a lot of help on this matter from the <A href="http://www.tweakheadz.com/how_to_record_vocals.htm">TweakHeadz</A> site. There&#8217;s all kinds of good stuff on that site.</p>

<p>anyways, this tune is another one <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bataille">larry hovish</a> and i collaborated on. we kinda were going for an alt-rock kind of feel, which i believe we suceeded in. furthermore, my solo in this tune has a nice crappy-neil-young quality to it. okay, that was not intentional, i was just sick of protools, and i didn&#8217;t feel like doing it over again.</p>

On a ghost train to chicago
Smoke billows through the air
The only light that's seen at night
Comes from over here

On a ghost train to chicago
I've got no place to go
Got no place to be
won't you sit down with me

i ride this train every night
because i've got no soul
on an eastbound train to chicago
i left her looking out the door

on a ghost train to chicago
i smelled the sweet scent of her hair
she fell off the back; i looked down the track
in the middle of nowhere

On a ghost train to chicago
Smoke billows through the air
The only light that's seen at night
Comes from over here
